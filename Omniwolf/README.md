# Omniwolf
Supplemental application for omniwolf.io, an open-source, distributed interface to set up Internet of Things devices, add actions (ex: text me when motion sensor is tripped), and pull data from various APIs and public/private sensors.

*Note: omniwolf.io may no longer be live as the project was created for Hack Arizona 2017 (hackathon).*
